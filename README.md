# Quick Messages

This is a client-side Minecraft Fabric mod that allows the user to send 
pre-defined chat messages and commands using a two-step hotkey.

## Usage and Configuration

In-game, pressing the menu key (default: K) will open the screen shown below.
You can then press another hotkey to send one of the listed messages, or 
add/edit hotkey/message combinations.

Note: While these hotkeys are separate from your Minecraft keybinds, they 
will overlap. For example, if you have '5' bound to 'Hotbar Slot 5' in 
Minecraft settings, and also have a message for it, when you press '5' to 
send the message, you will also select hotbar slot 5. However, if you press 
'5' in-game to select the hotbar slot, the message will not be sent since you 
are not doing it from the menu screen.
